    <p>
      <strong>Haley,</strong><br><br>
    
      Two months in and somehow you've shown me a kind of love I didn’t even know I was missing.<br><br>
    
      You make the ordinary feel lucky, like mornings are better just because you’re there, like being myself is finally enough.<br><br>
    
      When I took you home to LA and Luna chose <em>you</em> over me, I knew I was done for. She’s never trusted anyone like that waking you up with kisses every morning, claiming you like you were always meant to be there.<br><br>
    
      I think that’s how I feel too. Like somehow, in the middle of everything, I found something real.<br><br>
    
      And if love is learning, then I’m happy learning you.
    </p>
