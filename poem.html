    <p>
      <strong>Haley,</strong><br><br>
    
      Two months in<br>
      and somehow<br>
      you’ve shown me a kind of love<br>
      I didn’t even know<br>
      I was missing.<br><br>
    
      You make the ordinary feel lucky,<br>
      like mornings are better<br>
      just because you’re there,<br>
      like being myself is finally enough.<br><br>
    
      When I took you home to LA<br>
      and Luna chose <em>you</em> over me,<br>
      I knew I was done for.<br>
      She’s never trusted anyone like that<br>
      waking you up with kisses every morning,<br>
      claiming you like you were always meant to be there.<br><br>
    
      I think that’s how I feel too.<br>
      Like somehow,<br>
      in the middle of everything,<br>
      I found something real.<br><br>
    
      And if love is learning,<br>
      then I’m happy<br>
      learning you.
    </p>
